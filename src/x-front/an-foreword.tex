\chapter*{Foreword}

\begin{center}[ EARLY DRAFT STATE ]\end{center}

The bigbook has become the bedrock of the fellowship of Alcoholics. Many groups study the book weekly. It is described in the very second paragraph of it as a 'basic text'.

Members attempt to recall specific lines from memory in verbatim. There is a great many interpretations and discussions around spiritual developement through the text.

Many would say it contains a universal spiritual program and is therefore a piece of universal spiritual literature. It will likely persist for centuries.

This work transforms the presentation of the text, whilst preserving verbatim to its content, so to encode it in a form which universal texts generally take, and which will persist across centuries and millenia. In 1000 years from now, it will at the very least be a fundamental historical document.

A verse of text can generally correspond to a digestable unit of thought, a core idea being discussed. And therefore when a text is presented in this manner it can fascillitate a deeper connection to our psyche.

The generation of the text in verse has also been codified so to allow ease of cloning, so it can more easily become the foundation for ongoing commentarial and derivative works.
