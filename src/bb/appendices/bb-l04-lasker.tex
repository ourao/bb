\verse In 1951 the Lasker Award was given Alcoholics Anonymous.
\verse The citation reads in part as follows:


    \emph{"The American Public Health Association 
    presents a Lasker Group Award 1951 to Alcoholics Anonymous
    in recognition of its unique and highly successful approach 
    to that age-old public health and social problem,
    alcoholism...
\verse In emphasizing alcoholism as an illness,
    the social stigma associated with this condition is being
    blotted out...
\verse Historians may one day recognize Alcoholics Anonymous 
    to have been a great venture in social pioneering 
    which forged a new instrument for social action; 
    a new therapy based on the kinship of common suffering; 
    one having vast a potential for the myriad other ills of mankind."
