\verseWithHeading{Pioneers Of AA}
    Dr. Bob and the twelve men and women who here tell their stories 
    were among the early members of A.A.â€™s first groups.

\verse Though three have passed away of natural causes, 
    all have maintained complete sobriety 
    for periods ranging from fifteen to nineteen years 
    as of this date, 1955.

\verse Today, hundreds of additional A.A. members can be found 
    who have had no relapse for at least fifteen years.

\verse All of these, then, are the pioneers of A.A. 
\verse They bear witness that 
    release from alcoholism can really be permanent.
