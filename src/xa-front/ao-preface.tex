This Corpus transforms the presentation of the Basic Texts of A 
    into a codified form 
    in the manner which is typically implemented 
    within spiritual fields of study.
Within this project, this takes the form of 'Book Chapter:Verse', 
    where 'Book' corresponds to what was previously a chapter of a text, 
    and where 'Chapter' and 'Verse' are begun to be approximated.
The generation of 'Chapter' and 'Verse' will be an ongoing project,
    involving discernment of precise thematic shifts,
    which will necessarily involve subjective interpretation.

This codification is for the purpose of enabling deeper study 
    through the atomisation of referencable elements of the texts. 
The typical page number referencing used by readers 
    is insuficient for the level of precision 
    which is generally aimed at by readers of these texts.

The synthesis intends to better fascillate study and discussion 
    on the original chapters of the core set of publications 
    which are the spiritual driving force of various groups which use them.

This transformation of basic texts for commentary purposes 
    is not affiliate with A.A.
