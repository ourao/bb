# Big Book Codification

Codifying the Big Book through formalized referencing of the type subchapter:verse. For example 'Bill 3:2' would refer to the 2nd verse of the 3rd subsection of Bills Story. This also requires the categorisation of each chapter into subchapters.

The intention is to fascillitate open thought and study of the Big Book. To be a true basic text would necessitate a basic text formalism in referencing.

An added benefit of further subsectioning of the chapters is to provide a further manageable unit in regards to analysis and recall. The text is relatively dense and may benefit from further atomisation.

A verse may approximately correspond to an atomic unit of reference in the broadest sense.


## Example 2

Paragraph 1 of chapter 1, Bill's Story, becomes something like the following:

Bill 1

#### Beginnings **1**

**1** WAR FEVER ran high in the New England town to which we new, young officers from Plattsburg were assigned, and we were flattered when the first citizens took us to their homes, making us feel heroic. **2** Here was love, applause, war; moments sublime with intervals hilarious. **3** I was part of life at last, and in the midst of the excitement I discovered liquor. **4** I forgot the strong warnings and the prejudices of my people concerning drink. **5** In time we sailed for "Over There." **6** I was very lonely and again turned to alcohol.

Paragraph 3 of chapter 1, Bill's Story, becomes something like the following:
