# Big Book Codification

Codifying the Big Book through formalized referencing of the type subchapter:verse. For example 'Bill 3:2' would refer to the 2nd verse of the 3rd subsection of Bills Story. This also requires the categorisation of each chapter into subchapters.

The intention is to fascillitate open thought and study of the Big Book. To be a true basic text would necessitate a basic text formalism in referencing.

And added benefit of further subsectioning of the chapters is to provide a further manageable unit in regards to study. The text is relatively dense and may benefit from further atomisation.
